				<p><b>Why do you dance?</b>
					Dance is a whole other world for me. It’s my escape, it’s my peace, it’s the best way for me to release my emotions, and it’s one of my biggest comforts. I especially love how dance can bring people together and build such strong homes and communities
					</p><p>
					<b>Why did you join Aces?</b>
					I made Aces LOL. But the reason was, I saw there was a huge gap within our campus’s dance community. There were so many people who wanted to dance and perform but weren’t getting that opportunity because they lacked skill/foundation. If I had been turned away from my first hip hop crew because of my lack of skill at the time, I would be a totally different person. So I wanted to fill that gap and create a dance home for those people who wanted it and couldn’t find it elsewhere.
					</p><p>
					<b>Goals/vision for ADC:</b>
					I want ADC’s mission to align closely with Aces’ mission of providing a dance home for anyone willing to be a part of it. It’s challenging to find strong, supportive communities out in the adult world and I want ADC to be that for its members. I hope we can foster a sense of inclusivity in the dance space and eventually branch out to impact more individuals and incorporate more programming to grow that mission

				<p><b>Why do you dance?</b>
					I've grown up with dance as a part of my life. Before I ever danced in a choreography, there were social and cultural dances from back home in Togo to the steps and songs that permeated Black American culture. Movement has just always come to me. It's when I feel the safest to express myself, when I am all parts of me at once, and I feel most grounded in my body.
					</p><p>
					<b>Why did you join Aces?</b>
					Afsaneh. LOL, there really isn't much to say past that.
					</p><p>
					<b>Goals/vision for ADC:</b>
					I want to continue to curate spaces and places for people to connect with each other and themselves. I love the little community we have built that seems to evolve and grow as WE grow. Dance connects us in such varied ways and I want to continue to foster that feeling and community.

			<div class="text-left">
				<p><b>Why do you dance?</b>
					I dance to connect with other people in and around the community. Dance is a way for me to express myself and to communicate with others. I’ve met so many amazing and inspiring people through dance that I wouldn’t have otherwise been able to meet. 						
					</p><p>
					<b>Why did you join Aces?</b>
					I first joined Aces to be a part of a dance team and to try and improve at dancing! Over time, I continued to be a part of Aces not only to expand my range of dance styles/skills but also to build a welcoming dance community and have a safe space to share and connect via dance.
					</p><p>
					<b>Goals/vision for ADC:</b>
					In the short term – do everything a loose conglomeration of alumni was able to accomplish in the past year plus strengthening our community of alumni and providing more opportunities for people to dance, teach, and connect with each other even while apart. We’re just getting started &#128520;

				<p>I joined Aces the year it started by Afsaneh's invitation; at that time I had no dance experience, but I was almost immediately drawn to the way dance fostered an inclusive and supportive community. I think this is the core of Aces, and as engagement director my aim for ADC is to allow anyone interested in dance to experience the same joy and kinship.</p>

				<p><b>Why do you dance?</b>
					I dance because it's a release from the stress of daily life, and it's something that grounds me when I go through busy times.

					<b>Why did you join Aces?</b>
					I joined Aces because I didn't want to give up on dancing when I went to college and I was lucky enough to be asked to join this group! I stayed because I love the low-stress supportive atmosphere, and the friendliness whether you've interacted with a member hundreds of times or the first time!
					</p><p>
					<b>Goals/vision for ADC:</b>
					I hope that ADC can keep growing and be an avenue for people to stay connected!
